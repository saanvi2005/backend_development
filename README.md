# Python Backend Development 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning **Backend Development using Python**. It is a hands-on, project-driven space where I practice backend concepts, build small utilities, and gradually move towards scalable, real-world backend applications.

The goal of this repository is **learning by doing** — understanding how backend systems actually work instead of just memorizing theory.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Learn backend development from scratch using **Python**
* Understand how servers, APIs, databases, and filesystems work
* Build mini-projects to apply concepts practically
* Create a strong backend foundation for internships and real-world projects

---

## 🧠 What I Am Learning

### Core Python for Backend

* Python fundamentals (functions, modules, error handling)
* File handling (JSON, text files)
* Virtual environments

### Command Line & System

* Building CLI applications
* Handling command-line arguments (`sys.argv`)
* Working with the operating system (`os` module)

### Backend Concepts

* Request–response flow
* REST API basics (upcoming)
* Data validation and error handling
* Structuring backend projects

### Data & Storage

* JSON-based storage
* Introduction to databases (planned)

## ▶️ How to Run Projects

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project folder

```bash
cd project-folder
```

3. Run the Python file

```bash
python main.py
```

> Each project contains its own instructions inside its folder if required.

## 🌱 Learning Philosophy

* Build first, optimize later
* Make mistakes and fix them
* Focus on understanding **why**, not just **how**
* Keep projects simple but correct

This repository reflects **progress, not perfection**.

---

## 🚧 Future Plans

* Build REST APIs using Flask / FastAPI
* Add database support (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
* Learn authentication & authorization
* Deploy a backend service
* Write unit tests

---

## 📌 Note

This is a **learning repository**, and the code will continuously evolve as I grow as a backend developer.
